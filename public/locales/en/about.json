  "paragraph": {
    "first": "My mother told me that ever since I was little, I could pick any child’s lock. I was always curious to find out how mechanisms work, why certain things behave in the way they do and how to solve problems in the most efficient way.",
    "second": "When I was barely 13 years old, I started programming and was immediately amazed by the logical clarity of computers. Since then, I’ve been developing my skills, continuing teaching me new techniques and gaining experience. I am proud to say that I started freelancing successfully with just 16 years old.",
    "third": "I started my computer science studies at the Rheinische-Friedrich-Wilhelms University of Bonn in autumn 2024. I enjoy expanding my knowledge, gaining new insights into different companies and cultures and through that learning the tools to shape a better world."
